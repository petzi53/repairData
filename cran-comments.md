## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

changed the invalid (wrong) URL:
    URL: https://openrepair.org/open-data/insights/mobiles to
    URL: https://github.com/openrepair/data/tree/master/quests/mobiles

Checking with R-hub builder I received the NOTE:
> Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  ORDS (7:109)
  
But this is correct, it is an abbreviation and stands for
"Open Repair Data Standard"

**********************************************************

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

NOTE:
First release.
